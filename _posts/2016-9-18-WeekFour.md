Fourth Week, oh boy.
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?:</b>
<br>Worked on project 2, mostly. There's a lot of other stuff going on at school. Besides midterms and a Graphics project due, there's the career fair coming up, not that I'm going.
 In other news, this class is still going extremely well. Downing's been a consistently amazing lecturer. The visit from the Bloomberg rep was incredibly interesting. I've always loved teaching and tutoring others, and the outreach opportunities that Bloomberg offers are exactly what I'd love to do. I'll have to investigate the company.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>C++. I'm still not a fan of the language. I'm sure I would be if I were better at it but some things are just off-putting to me. The Boost library actually alleviates a lot of those
 concerns, though. I'll keep working at it, however. I'm sure C++ will be just as useful as Java in the professional world, if not more. At the very least, it's comforting that programming principles, such as algorithm design, are consistent, mostly, regardless of language.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>I need to finish project 2. I feel that we're making this project a little more complicated than it should be, and the code needs some restructuring, but I'm sure K and I can get a solid RMSE going.<br>
<br> For the tip of the week, <a href = "http://cscope.sourceforge.net/">Cscope</a> is actually incredibly cool. It's a text-based source code browser. You can do things like see which files contain calls to which functions and the overall structure of the code. Shout out to Don Fussell for showing his class this tool, or I might've never known.
<br><br>
Well, that's all for today. Fun times, hmm?
<br><br>
Until next time, dear reader.
