title: SWE Week Three!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
The semester is chugging along smoothly. This week I reviewed all of my forgotten python and ran around getting my financial situation sorted! It's been a bit of a hassle getting the money for books, but thankfully online resources and the library are fantastic. I also went home to San Antonio over the weekend. It costs a little bit of project time to do so, but it's always worth it.<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Definitely keeping up with readings, and managing my time. It's always been a problem of mine, but I'm trying a few different things that might help my time management. School gets in the way of my music practice, but I guess we all need priorities.<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Who knows?! I have a ton of homework and projects due. It looks like my classes all lined up to have due dates very close to each other, so it's going to take some work not to lull myself into a sense of security regarding due dates and then rush to turn in 3 different projects within 2 days of each other. Also, I'll be heading back home to San Antonio again. My family will be following up on the Dia de los Reyes celebration by hosting a dinner for our close friends. Unfortunately I won't be home to make the tamales, but family is filling in for me.<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
Fantastic, as expected. If I've been cold called, then it was the day that I missed, but Downing's lectures have never failed to amaze me. Consider me engaged!<br>
<br><b>tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
This is just general school advice. I'm sure that, given the requirements for this class, you're all well along in your academic careers, and so are familiar with the absolutely bonkers textbook system. Everyone knows about finding pdfs online and buying used books, but my tip today is to <b>check the library</b> and <b>ask your professors for class copies</b>! I can't tell you how much money it's saved me to simply communicate with the school and my professors. If you've got some books you're avoiding buying, talk to people!<br>
Until next time, dear reader.
