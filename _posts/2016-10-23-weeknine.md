Final stretch!
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>This week I finished up the Allocator program with my partner! Felt a little bad because he had so much OS work to do, but the program specs were concise enough that we were able to work together without too much time to talk about it. All in all, fun assignment. Class has been pretty cool too, I feel like I'm learning a lot. I remember not liking C++ when I first started learning programming and thinking it was a very ugly language. Then I came to UT and realized I just didn't know enough to appreciate C and C++, but this class is helping me get there.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>Exams for other classes. This upcoming Graphics exam is promising to be a particularly hard one. I still need quite a bit of reviewing before I'll feel ready to pass it, but we'll see.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>Next week will be pretty busy with studying, papers, and projects. Hopefully this upcoming project isn't too intense. In any case, I feel confident. I hope that we can get our exam results back soon. They seemed to be at least partially graded last week, so maybe some progress has been made<br>
<br>No tip this week. Unless you count a high recommendation for apricot jam as a tip. You should, it's delicious.
<br>
Until next time, dear reader.
