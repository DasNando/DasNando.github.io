title: Week Seven!
---

La septima semana.
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>Took the OOP exam! All in all it was fair, I suppose. A little shallow but that's alright, I still feel that I did well enough. I've also been working on a Graphics project for Fussell's class. Apart from all the programming, I've been making more music, so that's a plus. The weather's finally nice enough to start running, too.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>As of right now, the specs for the next OOP project. Not sure what to make of them, but I'm sure we'll get more details on Mnoday. CMake has also been an enormous hassle when I try to develop anything in CLion, so I may switch away from it.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>Start on the project, as usual. I need to finish this Graphics project first and foremost, then I have a few essays to write for my remaining classes. It's looking to be a pretty busy week! When I get the time, I've also been looking into some fun applications of Markov chains, namely in phrase generators. I might cook one up and train it on some famous novels, see what gems I can pick out.<br>
<br>
My tip for this week is, again, not CS related. The Fall is here and the weather is beautiful. Go outside, go for a walk and take what you will from it.
<br>
Hope you're all doing well, friends.
<br><br>
Until next time, dear reader.
