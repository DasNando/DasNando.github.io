title: SWE Week Ten!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This week, I slowed down my work pace a little bit. I have a lot of time for my projects, so I thought I'd take it easy and go home a little earlier than usual. Thankfully, we mostly have the dynamic part of the website up and running, so the remaining work is minimal.<br>Oh! This Monday we had a presentation from Atlassian! I thought it was fantastic, the only talks that have gotten me that excited were the Google and Bloomberg talks. I liked the flexibility of Google's cloud services and Bloomberg's community outreach and service programs seemed like something I'd like to be a part of, but Atlassian really took the cake. Their attitudes in particular were impressive, as they're the first company I've ever heard speak that was at least trying not to be pretentious. As a fan of collaborative programming and team-centric software, the collaborative nature of their products also strongly pushed me towards them. In any case, I did start the week motivated enough to talk to a career advisor to consider applying for an internship with them. However, as the week progressed and I wrote my resume, I realized I can't <i>really</i> intern due to a lack of personal projects, so I've come to the decision to go back to construction work after I finish my degree, for which I only need 3 more hours. That may change, but it seems like a good choice for now.<br>Still, I'm excited that companies like Atlassian exist! Some day :^)<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
The biggest thing in my way for this class is the lack of synergy in my team. Although willing to work, competing priorities have kept our productivity lower than it could be, but that's normal! I can't expect to be in sync with a group I met 3 weeks ago, and we're all making efforts to figure things out, so I'm optimistic! All in all, the project is going very well and I don't think I've ever been prouder of a project than I have been with this one. I'm learning so much about so many different things!<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Finish up this project!! I still have to figure out a smooth way to get continuous integration between GCP/GAE, Travis, and Github. Mostly, Travis is the troublemaker between the three, but Google's extensive documentation should make it easier as I read more and more into it.<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b>
Good! I'm enjoying the diverse topics we've been covering in this class throughout the semester. Now that we're on the topic of SQL, I'm really starting to appreciate a language that I long thought to be tedious and hacky. I'm excited to keep learning more!<br>
<br><b>tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
For my tip of the week, I'd like to show you <a href="https://regex101.com/">Regex101</a>! This website really helped me understand the way that regex grouping works. Try plugging in a few of the strings from the practice files on the class website to see in-depth explanations of the whole thing!
Until next time!
