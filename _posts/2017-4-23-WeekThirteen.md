title: SWE Week Thirteen!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This past week, my team and I finished the final project for this class! It was a struggle, but we got most of it done. Shout out to Dylan Droll, who really ramped up the effort and made the website look incredible. I also started my internship application process. I know it's a bit late, but I actually have a few interviews lined up! Exciting!<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Too much to do! I wish I had more time. The saving grace here is that there's a lull before the exam for this class. A lot of my other classes suddenly became very demanding, and I simply do not have the time.<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Interviews! There's a few very promising opporunities coming up for this summer. I'm a bit nervous, especially since I've never had an interview that wasn't for WalMart or Tech Support. Still, I'm excited. I'll actually be able to pay my rent this summer!!<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
Finishing out the semester strong! On a real note, the things I've learned in this class have really helped me. I don't think I'd be getting these interviews if it wasn't for these classes. One of the interviews I had recently actually went extremely well because I was the first candidate to have used Google Cloud Platform, which I used for this class.<br>
<br><b>tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
For my tip this week, I'd like to recommend <a href="https://fiddles.io/">Fiddles IO</a>, a set of online emulators for various languages. Their most popular one is their Javascript Fiddle, which allows you to test HTML, CSS, and Javascript and see the results immediately. A lot are still in the works, such as their Python Fiddle, but it's still a good tool for quick testing, such as syntactical questions.<br>
Until next time!
