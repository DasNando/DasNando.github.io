title: SWE Week Nine!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
Got back from Spring Break! I ended spending most of my time with my family and friends in San Antonio, which was a really sweet time. I always forget just how comfortable it is to be home. I know that city so well, my friends and I drive all around it going to our favorite little spots and it's simply the most satisfying thing.<br>As soon as I got back from break, it was time to jump into Project #3. Over the break I had done research on Flask, and it ended up being a little more confusing than I expected at first, but after this first phase I can say I'm very comfortable with it. Despite being undermanned(or underpersonned?), my team and I ended up finishing the whole thing, with the exception of a slightly sub-par API documentation and technical report. Shout out to Dylan, who spent a night at the labs trying to get his GUI looking just the way he wanted, it really shone through.<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
As far as the project goes, the lack of people is annoying. I understand there's another group with only four students, but it isn't much consolation. There's a particular bug where things either won't render properly or the site will crash on the custom domain, but will work perfectly fine on the default domain that Google App Engine provides. I'm still looking for a solution.<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Hopefully talk to a career advisor, as I'm just as lost as I ever was in the job department. I also want to look in to the rest of the tool for this next phase of the project, as none of my team members have the experience.<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b>
The fun continues! I've been doing much better on the quizzes, partially as a result of going home and trying out the programming excercises and re-reading the articles in the morning during breakfast. I'm glad I was able to change direction from the beginning of the semester when I hardly came to class. The lectures are still super rewarding to listen to!<br>
<br><b>tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
For my tip this week, I'd like to point out that <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/">SQLZoo</a> is a thing. They have some practice-based lessos for SQL that I've found useful. It's not closely following what we do in class, but it's good to get familiar with the language(this includes Postgre).
Until next time!
