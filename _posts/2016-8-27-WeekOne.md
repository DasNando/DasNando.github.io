Alright friends, <b>let's</b> get <b>explicit</b>.
<br><br>
<b>What did you do this week?:</b><br>
<p>This week we covered class logistics and talked about a few useful development tools, namely; GoogleTest and gcov. We also went over a few of the differences between Java and C++. I managed to get the docker image set up on Wednesday, and have spent the days since then getting comfortable with git and github again. It didn't take long to get this blog set up, but I'll probably spend a few hours in the following weeks getting it to look better.</p><br><br>
<p>Well, we've only had a day and a half's worth of class time, but we're already getting into a good 
class flow. </p>
