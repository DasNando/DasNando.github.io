title: SWE Week Six!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This past week I made some progress towards what I'll really be doing for my Mobile Development class! Depending on the app, I may even post it to one of these blogs towards the end of the semester! We are now at the first lull before the exams! Next week, we have our first exam for this class, and so I took some time this weekend to practice the essential Python basics that I'm sure will come in handy. I wrote a form of RangeIterator, and now I'm hoping that I can apply that to any situation which may come up in the exam. If this is anything like the OOP exams, flexibility in design will be important.<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
This exam! Normally I do very well in exams, but this one has me a little nervous. However, all it takes is a little bit of practice and I'm sure I'll feel better about it. I also still need project group for this class but according to Downing, many people drop after the first exam, and so it might not be worth trying just yet, as it would take a lot of effort for uncertain results.<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I'm still going to be looking for project partners. I'd also like to stop by office hours with one of the TAs and get a better feel for what I should be able to do for the exam. Thankfully, I'm fairly comfortable with Python, so I don't have an immense amount to worry about. Despite my worries over this exam, or perhaps because of them, I'll be going back to San Antonio on Tuesday for a concert by my favorite band in the world!! Remember to take breaks, friends. Your wellbeing is more important than your grade (to a point.)<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b>
I'm incredibly disappointed that I had to miss class on Friday! Otherwise, everything is going well! I'm actually enjoying the group exercises. Talking with my classmates can be fun sometimes, and it helps to see that the naive vision that everyone but you knows exactly what they're doing is unfounded.<br>
<br><b>tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a handy book/website called <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>! It's a book/tutorial series designed to teach you the nuances of Python. If you're enjoying Python because of this class, this is a fun exercise-driven resource that could help put you on your way to true mastery of Python! There's also editions for other programming languages, but the Python site is by far the best.
Until next time, friends.
