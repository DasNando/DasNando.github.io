title: Week Eleven!

We're almost done! :D
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>Well, my partner and I finished the Darwin project! We actually turned it in at 9:57pm on the day it was due, and it was much more "exciting" than I was looking forward to. The project wasn't too hard, but I wish we could get some better direction on how to apply these Object Oriented principles. For the most part, the TAs would give different answers about what was and was not acceptable. I get that the project gave us a lot of liberty to do what we wanted, making it hard to give straight answers, but maybe a little more dedicated class time or an example program would help the concepts stick.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>These new principles, maybe! I feel like I have a good grasp of it, but I have no idea! I haven't gotten any yes or no answers on whether or not my methods are okay. I guess I'll find out soon, so I'll do some googling in the meantime. My quiz grade is probably suffering right now, too. I haven't done very well on these recent quizzes, so I'll have to improve that as well.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>Now that the timer's been reset for this class, I'll be focusing on Graphics, at least for the next few days.<br>
<br>

Until next time, dear reader.
