Week numero six.
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>This week has been a quiet one for OOP. With projects or homework of any sort on the horizon, the only thing to do now is prep for the exam. I don't really know what to expect, but open-note exams are always very bright red flags. They're sensible, sure. We won't ever be told not to research things we don't know once we're actually out in the workforce, but they still tend to be pretty tough. We'll see. I've gone over the readings and class notes, and hopefully it will be enough.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>Again, nothing really. The attendance policy is starting to feel a bit harsh considering the state of my mental health, but it's not exactly something you can haggle over, so I just have to keep showing up to class. The material itself is intuitive, the only exception being pointers. Maybe writing out some short example code will help drive some of those points home.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>Review a couple more times for this exam, and hopefully get an early start on my other projects and essays.<br>
<br> For the tip of the week, <a href = "http://bigocheatsheet.com/#">The Big O Cheat Sheet</a> is something that a lot of students probably used when first getting into data structures, but I recently rediscovered it due to this last project and it's a fun tool that can help you quickly decide which type of data structure best suits your needs. It doesn't cover all structures or specify implementations, but all in all, it's worth using if you haven't memorized every detail of the various commonly used data structures.

We're a third of the way through the semester, everyone! Wooh!
<br><br>
Until next time, dear reader.
