title: Week Eight!
---

Past the halfway mark!
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>Worked on a Graphics project and worked on a few of my other classes. For Graphics, we just finished a Menger Sponge generator project, which was surprisingly fun. I'm looking into developing with OpenGL on my personal computer, but a lot of the setup is beginner-hostile, so I'm probably giving that up since I definitely can't figure it out. Nothing's going on in OOP. A lot of talk about pointers.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>Barring health issues, not very much. Cmake has caused me at least a dozen headaches recently, but oh well. My other classes are going fine. I suppose all that's in my way is getting to regiter on time for once. The instructions for this project aren't terribly precise. I've been taking that as a license to do whatever I feel like doing with it, so hopefully that doesn't backfire.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>Not to sound like a broken record here, but I'll be finishing the project for this class and prepping for the second wave of exams for my other classes. Maybe I'll get some sleep for a change, but that seems less and less likely as the weekend progresses. School-wise, I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary; reading a couple of chapters of some textbooks, typing some code here and there.<br>
<br>
This week I found <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>, a programming language built on Java. I couldn't really speak to the benefits of using it, as I only discovered it a couple of days ago, but it's a lot of fun to write in. Apparently, it's supposed to have a much smaller overhead than standard Java and a better runtime, but hey, maybe go try it out for yourselves.
<br>
Good luck on the project and your upcoming exams, friends.
<br><br>
Until next time, dear reader.
