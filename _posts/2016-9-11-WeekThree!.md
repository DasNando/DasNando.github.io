title: Week Two!
---

We're really getting into the <b>groove</b> of things now, aren't we?
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?:</b>
<br><b>Finished Project 1!</b>
Oh man that was nerve-wracking. Principally because of the requirement that the assignment be absolutely 100% complete or it would not receive a grade. I must've looked over my repo a dozen times making sure each file was present and in the correct format and completely updated to the latest version. The newline issue was a bit bothersome, but all in all I'm confident I did well.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>Unfortunately, the workload in a few classes that I hadn't expected to be heavy at all. Regarding this class however, nothing is in my way. I may not be a C++ guru but I'm doing well thus far and I know I'm capable of continuing to do so.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>Hopefully start preparing for the first wave of midterms. I haven't found the time to get this blog looking any better, but that's how it goes. Not very much on my plate after this first project finished, so I'm coasting for now.<br>

About the class, it felt nice to hear Downing address the way many CS students (along with everyone else in the world) can feel about their own abilities. I haven't actually ever had an internship in four years for exactly this reason, and it doesn't seem like there's any room in CS for people like me. We'll see. But this class feels like a good start, and that's enough.
<br>
<b>WHEW!</b> Got a little personal there, didn't we, reader?
<br> Oh well, this blog is as much for me as it is for anything else, so no worries.
<br>As for the tip of the week: I recently came across <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>. After we were asked to keep track of our working time, I realized how absolutely impossible it is to care about time when you're so busy. I haven't gotten a chance to use Toggl yet, but maybe for this next project!
<br>
<br>
Until next time, dear reader.
