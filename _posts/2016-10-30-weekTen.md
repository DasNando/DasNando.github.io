Post-exam report!
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>This week was exam on top of exam and I spent just about all of my time sleeping and reading. It's a grind we're all familiar with but I feel like it paid off, for the most part. The Graphics exam is the exception to the "most part" of the last sentence. The exam wasn't difficult, or shouldn't have been, but it involved so much math that we've had practically no practice with. But, oh well. Such is life.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>Oh boy, this project. The program itself isn't difficult to implement if we just dove straight at the naive implementation. However, we need to start getting into the feel of more object-oriented design and it's giving me some trouble. I understand the need for modularity, but this is the first time I've been asked not to use getters and setters, and it's taken some adjusting to.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>

Until next time, dear reader.
