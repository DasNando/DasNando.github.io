Thanksgiving day approaches!!<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>My partner and I finished up the Life project! After Darwin, it wasn't very hard to get a good grasp of this project, but it's the first project where I felt a little bit carried. However, I get the concepts and I contributed well enough, so I suppose it's all the same. I've also gotten started on my practice files for the upcoming exam. From the last exam, I'm certain that the way I should prepare for this exam is simply to go out and write these classes and methods again and again, so that's what I'm doing. Besides this class, there's been a few developments in my Graphics class. I'm getting to choose my own final project, so I've been looking into some potentially cool things to do. Maybe I'll post a demo here once I've made more progress!<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>Not very much in this class. If I had to say something, I'd say lack of practice. C++ isn't my language of choice and having to bounce between the syntax of one language and another can get the wires crossed occasionally. This goes double for the little nuanced differences between language structures. Practice, practice, practice! I'd also like to speak to anybody about the CS culture and getting jobs and all of that. Given that I've never been a part of the CS community and have never kept copies of past projects, I'm extremely lost. Hopefully ACM can help me, but they seem to be my only option.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>Continue writing this big 'ol file to prep for the exam. Thanksgiving is coming up! I don't actually celebrate Thanksgiving. My entire family and I are Mexican and we've never felt any connection to the holiday, but I'm more than happy to take a week off from sleeping at the labs to go home and see my friends. Unfortunately, I still have class on Monday and Tuesday, but that's alright.<br>
<br>
This week, I'd like to recommend yet another golden nugget from my Graphics class, <a href="https://threejs.org/">The ThreeJS Library</a>, a javascript library which uses WebGL to create 3D graphics in-browser! Flip through their examples page for some cool ideas! I don't have much JavaScript experience, but I'll be giving it a shot over the next few days with this library.
<br>
Enjoy your vacation, friends!

Until next time, dear reader.
