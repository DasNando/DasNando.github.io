So close, we're so close.
<br>

<b>What did you do this week?</b>
<br>My partner and I got started on the new project. We've only worked on it briefly but we're on the same page and everything is moving along very smoothly, so I'm sure that we'll do well on the assignment. I haven't had much to do this past week, very few papers and assignments due, and it's feeling a little like the calm before the storm. The due date for my Graphics project got moved back by almost a week, and I couldn't be happier about it. Besides that, I did get to go to San Antonio and visit my family. While I was there, there was a huge anti-trump protest that was fun to watch over a bowl of ice cream, although unfortunately nothing got too wild.<br>

<b>What's in your way?</b>
<br>I still haven't been feeling at 100%. I'm thinking about going to the CMHC, but that's still up for debate. Schoolwise, we've finally gotten to the point where all of the constructors and their behaviors are starting to get a bit muddled in my head. It's incredibly interesting, though, and what better catalyst for learning is there? I'll get it in my head, I just need to go out and actually write a huge test class myself.<br>

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<br>The same old thing I've written here for twelve weeks, I'll be finishing up this project and working on my Graphics assignment. Not a very exciting post, I know, but it's the truth. I'd like to get this week done early so I can focus on my music, though. I brought some of my equipment from home and I'd like to develop myself further as a musician, but all in due time.<br>
<br>
This week, I'd like to recommend another podcast, the <a href="http://bigthink.com/articles?blog=think-again-podcast">BigThink Podcast</a>. It's an hour-long variety podcast that focuses on topics of sociology, philosophy, and ethics. The podcast is a little less digestible than the 15-minute history podcast I recommended last time, but it's interesting if you're willing to give the ideas a thought and challenge them, and yourself.
<br>
Alright, that's all! I hope you enjoyed your weekend, friends.
<br><br>
Until next time, dear reader.
