title: SWE Week Eight!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
My main focus this past week was my AI class! We had an exam on Thursday and, although I knew what to expect, it still took a bit of focus to prepare for. I ended up doing very well! This is the first time I've ever gotten results for a written exam back within a couple days of taking it. Typically, it takes a lot more time to grade the written responses, so it was a pleasant surprise to get that out of my mind right before Spring Break. Also, I got my group for this upcoming project! We've started talking on Slack and I'm hopeful for this project!<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
This may sound selfish, but the thing in my way is the number of projects that I have to do over this break. I have 3 projects all due the week I get back to school. Oh well. The other thing in my way is meeting with my group! I'd love to get everybody together in one place and discuss the project, but that won't be happening until we get back from break.<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
<i><b>W Y L '  O U T</b></i>. Just kidding. I may go to a show or two, but mostly I'll be spending the week with my loved ones in San Antonio. I've been reading up on the tools that we'll need for this project and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. Thankfully, there's a ton of tutorials online which will help be get my bearings. For now, I'm focusing on learning Flask. It's pretty minimalist, so I think I can do a good job of applying it to the project, but the devil is always in the details, so I'll have to make sure I apply it <i>correctly</i>.<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b>
It's been fun. I'm enjoying the talks that we've been asked to attend. Google's presentation in particular was very exciting, so much so that they convinced me to learn Google's cloud services over Amazon's. Class itself has been fun too, professor Downing was merciful enough to let us take Friday off! That meant that my Thursday suddenly became a weekend, and I had a lot of fun hanging out with some friends instead of thinking about class.<br>
<br><b>tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
For my tip this week, I'd like to recommend tutorials by <a href="https://thenewboston.com/videos.php">TheNewBoston</a>. He is a video content creator who specializes in practical, casual programming tutorials. He has some short series on ReactJS and Python Web Dev, one of which is a short introduction to Flask. If you're into this whole Web Dev thing, he also has some longer video series on PHP. Check him out for some casual learning over the break!
Until next time, dear reader.
