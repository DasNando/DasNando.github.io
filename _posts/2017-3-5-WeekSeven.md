title: SWE Week Three!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
Finished up Collatz along with about three other projects. I knew they would pile on with the synced due dates, but even so, I underestimated it. I ended up having a major cache bug in my Collatz program that meant I had to rewrite a sizable chunk of the source code, along with implementing an efficient cache in Python. I suppose I was overconfident because of my experience with caching in OOP last year. I won't make that mistake again.<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Nothing, this week. I'm getting back on track, however slowly.<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Get started on this Netflix assignment! If last year taught me anything about this project, it's that getting useful caches and everything else in order is the most time-consuming part of this, so start early! I also have a project due for AI very soon, so I need to finish that off. We're working on algorithms for Pac-Man, so I definitely can't say that I'm bored!<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b>
My anxiety got the best of me the last time I was called, and so I ended up losing a quiz. However, Downing messaged me asking what happened. It always feels good to have a professor that cares about each of his students, and I can't express how much I appreciate it.<br>
<br><b>tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
There is a company named <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/>JetBrains</a> that develops IDEs for multiple languages, including Java(And its Android-specialized cousin), Python, and C++. For this project I used PyCharm and I highly recommend it! The github integration is immensely helpful, allowing you to do anything you would do with git normally. The IDE comes with a python console and a terminal built in for ease of access, and allows plugins to run scripts with coverage, allowing you to run unit tests quickly and efficiently. It even comes with pylint and automatically warns you when your code deviates from formatting conventions. Best of all, you can get a student license and use it for free!
Until next time, dear reader.
