title: SWE Week Seven!
---

<br><b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This week, we took our first exam for this class! I went in confident in my conceptual understanding, but feeling underpracticed. The test was different than what I expected, as there was a much stronger focus on the readings than I thought there'd be. The programming questions focused more on knowledge of concepts and Python's mechanics, so it suited my preparation much better than a written exam. In the end, I did very well on the exam! I also finalized my group for Mobile Computing, so I'll have to start working our meeting times into my schedule.<br>
<br><b>What's in your way?</b><br>
The groups for this class! I failed to find a group in time, so it looks like I'll be placed in a group at random on Monday. I'm not totally opposed to the idea, since all of my classmates seem like fine people, I'd just like to avoid any conflicting styles when I can. Although, I guess conflicting workflows are part of working in groups, so it might be good practice for the workforce if my group is not on the same page.<br>
<br><b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Meet my group and prepare for one of the most important weeks of the year; <i><b>spring break</b></i>! Jokes aside, I do have an exam for my Artificial Intelligence class that I need to prepare for, and a few homework assignments to knock out before I really get into break mode.<br>
<br><b>What's my experience of the class?</b>

Until next time, dear reader.
